%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part1: run "Part_1.m" in the following way:

%% section #1: Parameter Setting
K = 3, 7, 11
type = 'RGB', 'LUV'

-------------------------------------
%% section #2: Random initial
to get the result of random initial:
run #1 then #2

-------------------------------------
%% section #3: Manual initial
to get the result of random initial:
run #1 then #3
You need to choose input points


(Totally 12 combinations: 3(K) x 2(type) x 2(section for input method) = 12(images))


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part2: run "Part_2.m"


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Part3: run "Part_3.m" & "Part_3_sp.m" for "color" and "color + space" respectively

---
(A) for RGB & (C) for LUV: For only color feature, run "Part_3.m"
parameter setting:
type = 'RGB' or 'LUV'
bandwidth = ???
thres_similar = ???



---
(B) for RGB & (C) for LUV: For space & color feature, run "Part_3_sp.m"
parameter setting:
type = 'RGB' or 'LUV'
bandwidth = ???
thres_similar = ???
bandwidth_sp = ???
thres_similar_sp = ???
