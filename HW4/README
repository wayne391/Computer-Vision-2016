Part 1:

	Run "Part_1.m"
	A - section "%% Prob. A"
	B, C - seciont "%% Prob. B, C"

	Note that I've saved variables of corners of books in 'corner_list.mat', if you wnat to re-label it, you can uncomment code.

Part 2:
	Run "Part_1.m" directly, I've saved better results. 
	If you want to examine the procedures of A, B and C, yo can uncomment section '%%  get  transformed img' than run the section '%% Combine Pictures'

	the images of the section '%%  get  transformed img'  is the discussion and trial of A, B, C

	"" Note that if you uncomment the section '%%  get  transformed img and then re-compute, there may be  exist an opportinuty that code can;t work correctly because my code is not flexible. Just keep try it, or you just don't save it"
